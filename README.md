# iot_alexa_printer
IOT Python Script for Alexa
This project uses a raspberry pi zero device to host FLASK which allows Alexa to send items to it via a web request. The items we're storing are grocery shopping items. We can then trigger the label printer its hooked up to to print our grocery list before heading out to the store.
